🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project
Predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques

📌 Overview
This project uses historical passenger data from the Titanic to predict whether a passenger survived or not using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to apply data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques to solve a binary classification problem.

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset provided by Kaggle.

It includes features like:

PassengerId,
Pclass (Ticket Class),
Name,
Sex,
Age,
SibSp (Siblings/Spouses Aboard),
Parch (Parents/Children Aboard),
Ticket,
Fare,
Cabin,
Embarked,
Survived (Target variable),

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python ,
Pandas,
NumPy,
Matplotlib / Seaborn,
Scikit-learn,
Jupyter Notebook,

🧠 ML Algorithms Applied
Logistic Regression,
K-Nearest Neighbors,
Decision Tree,
Random Forest,
Support Vector Machine,
(Optional) XGBoost,

🔍 Insights
Females had a higher survival rate than males.
Passengers in higher classes (Pclass=1) had better chances of survival.
Children also had better survival chances.
